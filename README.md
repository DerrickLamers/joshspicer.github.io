# joshspicer.com

Current* iteration of my website! This repo hold all the code that serves as my front page on the internet!  I recently started from scratch with this site - check out my [previous homepage here](https://github.com/joshspicer/josh_personal_site_old).

This is a Jekyll site based off of diezcami's [arctic fox theme](https://github.com/diezcami/arctic-fox-theme).


## Notable Additions 

Blog posts are stored in [_posts](/_posts).

Various scripts, including client-side Spotify polling code, can be found in [js](/js).

Client-side code interfacing with my "Spotify Public Queue" can be found in [/spotify.html](/spotify.html)
