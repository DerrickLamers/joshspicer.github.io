> Welcome!

Originally a Northeastern polls server, I now run this minecraft server for anyone that wants to use it. **Be nice to other players and respectful of their builds!**

**We have a whitelist** - Please simply [**message me on facebook**](https://m.me/spicer.josh), or contact me [**some other way**](/contact) and i'll be sure to add you.

Also be sure to join the [**server's discord**](https://discord.gg/b9HJEVH).

**The server's address** --> `mc.spicer.dev`
