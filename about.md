I’m **Josh** - a Boston-based college student studying Computer Science at [**Northeastern University**](http://ccs.neu.edu/home/joshua). 

📍 I'm currently an intern at [**Microsoft**](https://microsoft.com/) working on Scalable Cloud API services for Office 365 Products.

☕️ I abide by the three C's: <b>concerts, coffee</b>, and <b>[cats](../cinnamon)</b>.


<br>
### What i've done.

<br>
🔏 Co-op'ed for seven months as a **Security Consultant** for [**Virtual Security Research**](http://vsecurity.com). I performed application, network, and mobile **penetration testing** for client companies.

🌐 Co-op'ed (again) - this time at [**Akamai Technologies**](https://akamai.com/) on their **Enterprise Network Engineering team**.


🏡 Lived (briefly) in [**Florence, Italy**](https://joshspicer.com/geo-fellowship) and more recently in [**Edinburgh, UK**](https://joshspicer.com/hitch-to-paris), where I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh. 

<br>
### What else do I do?

<br>
🐘 Develop [**Parade**](https://parade.events/) - an event discovery platform for Northeastern clubs. Find us on the [iOS App Store](https://parade.events/ios) and [Google Play Store](https://parade.events/android), and learn about us from our [News@Northeastern article](https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/07/23/want-to-know-whats-happening-on-northeasterns-boston-campus-theres-an-app-for-that/)

🎧 Spend (too much) time (and money) constructing elaborate [spotify playlists]({{site.url}}/monthly-playlist-2018) and buying concert tickets. I <3 cheap shows and discovering new music - help me out by adding something to my [public queue](https://joshspicer.com/queue)!

🎛 Participate on the [**Collegiate Cyber Defense Team**](https://nuccdc.club/). This year we have advanced on to regionals!

🌋 Help produce [**Survivor Northeastern**](http://survivornortheastern.com). I played season 3 - check it out on YouTube _soon_!

🖥 Co-founded Northeastern clubs like the Computer Science Mentoring Organization [(CoSMO)](https://nuCoSMO.club/), and help run clubs like [nuACM](https://acm.org). CoSMO runs interactive technical workshops and runs student-driven panels throughout the semester - let me know if you'd like to run one!
