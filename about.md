I’m **Josh** - a Boston-based college student studying computer science at [**Northeastern University**](http://ccs.neu.edu/home/joshua). I’m currently on co-op at [**Akamai Technologies**](https://akamai.com/) on the **Network Engineering team**.

#### What i've done.

<br>
🔏 Previously worked as a **Security Consultant / Pentester** for [**Virtual Security Research**](http://vsecurity.com) (a part of **NCC Group**). I performed application, network, and mobile penetration testing for client companies. I also executed multiple social engineering campaigns and conducted “red team” assessments against various companies.

🏡 Lived (briefly) in [**Florence, Italy**](https://joshspicer.com/geo-fellowship) and more recently in [**Edinburgh, UK**](https://joshspicer.com/hitch-to-paris), where I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh. I grew up just south of Boston.

#### What I do now.

<br>
🐘 Develop [**Parade**](https://parade.events/) - an event discovery platform for Northeastern clubs. Find us on the [iOS App Store](https://parade.events/ios) and [Google Play Store](https://parade.events/android)!

🎧 Spend (too much) time and money constructing elaborate [spotify playlists]({{site.url}}/monthly-playlist-2018) and buying concert tickets. I <3 cheap shows and discovering new music - help me out by adding something to my [public queue](https://joshspicer.com/queue)!

🎛 Participate on the [**Collegiate Cyber Defense Team**](https://nuccdc.club/). This year we have advanced on to regionals!

🌋 Help produce [**Survivor Northeastern**](http://survivornortheastern.com). I played season 3 - check it out on YouTube _soon_!

🖥 Co-founded Northeastern clubs like the Computer Science Mentoring Organization [(CoSMO)](https://www.facebook.com/nuCoSMO), and help run clubs like [nuACM](https://acm.com). CoSMO runs interactive technical workshops and runs student-driven panels throughout the semester.
