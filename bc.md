Boston Calling is an incredibly special event for me annually. For the past several years, this weekend has held  my fondest college memories, and I think this festival as a whole truly embodies how awesome a city Boston is.  Boston Calling also has the ability (especially recently) to promote local indie artists in such a powerful way - something I definitely want to be a part of.

I grew up right outside of Boston and go to school at Northeastern.   When i’m not in class studying computer science, i’m out at the Royale, or Brighton Music Hall, or some house show on Mass Ave with friends enjoying the best part of living in Boston - the music.  I’m averaging about 3  shows a month this semester - and it just doesn’t seem like enough. What Boston Calling does is bring this amazing music culture out in the open for all Bostonians to enjoy. This festival gets better and better each year with its ability to provide a platform for not only giant artists, but for smaller indies artists to get the recognition they deserve.

One great example this year is artist Sidney Gish.  Sidney is actually former roommates with a good friend of mine, and thus i’ve met her, and (fervently) listen to her music. She’s an amazingly talented artist, and i’m so excited that Boston Calling is giving her this platform to share her music with such a large audience.

To be a part of the staff would be an amazing experience, and allow me to help create and share my love for this festival!

I’ll leave you with a photo I took at the end of the Weezer show in 2017.  This photo marked the end of one of my favorite nights of the year!
