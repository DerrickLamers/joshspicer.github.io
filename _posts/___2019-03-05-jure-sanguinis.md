[Jure Sanguinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis), or "right of blood", is a principle of nationality law that many countries (notably for me, Italy) uses to determine citizenship. I grew up hearing about my great maternal grandparents who immigrated from Italy. I discovered jure sanguinis and wondered if I was eligible. If I was eligible, I would be able to claim my citizenship, and eventually apply for an Italian passport, allowing me to live and work in the EU indefinitely.

I won't go into the full details of understanding if you qualify (there are some great resources [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_nationality_law) and [here](https://www.myitalianfamily.com/apply-italian-citizenship/learn-if-you-qualify).

If you determine you qualify, you'll essentially need proof of unbroken Italian lineage (ending at you) in the form of birth, marriage, death, and naturalization certificates. This includes birth records of your most recent Italian ancestor. You'll need all of these internationally certified and translated to Italian. You'll then need to book an appointment with an your local Italian consulate, pay Italy some money, wait for Italy to give you the thumbs up.

The Boston consulate website provides this [informational document](https://consboston.esteri.it/consolato_boston/resource/doc/2016/05/juresanguinis.pdf) that clearly lays out all the documents they expect the day of your appointment.

A key thing to note for many Americans (that may disqualify you) is whether your Italian relative renounced his citizenship in favor of naturalizing in a foreign country (like the US), and whether their child (your next link in the chain) was born before or after. You'll need to take another close look at the dates if your Italian relatives were female (due to some antiquated Italian statutes...ugh).

Some things to note for _my_ particular search. I (1) live in Boston and am under the juristiction of the [Boston Italian Consulate](https://consboston.esteri.it/consolato_boston/it/), (2) all of my ascendents relevant to this process have lived their lives completely in Massachusetts (birth, marriage, etc...). I've seen online some people that had to get certain documents from various states (eg: Mom was born in state X, Dad in state Y, and married in state Z). That is not the case for me, which simplifies a lot! Your mileage may vary if you live elsewhere. Below is the entire timeline outlining my process for claiming (or failing in claiming) Italian citizenship.

A warning - this process is not particularly simple, cheap, or quick. Proceed at your own risk of sanity.

## Timeline

### December 31st, 2019

This process all began at a New Year’s Eve party. I was told by a friend that her parents had claimed her Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis. I knew my mom’s family has emigrated to the United States from Italy - that got me curious (and down this rabbit hole!).

### January 1st, 2020

I first started by asking my family (namely my mom and my aunt) about what they remembered of their grandparents. They were very helpful - my aunt even had a couple relevant documents (and photos of my grandfather!).

I then moved onto a free trial on [Ancestry.com](http://ancestry.com), which was incredibly helpful. Most of my family tree was already partially constructed. Ancestry showed that my maternal grandparents had arrived to the United States around the turn of the century, with my grandfather being the first one of my maternal family born in the United States.

The most interesting find were the original Petition for Naturalization records for my great-grandfather. I found original scans of the documents on Ancestry stating his full name, birth date, date of arrival in the US, and more.

As I said above, an important “gotcha” is to note when my great grandfather _actually_ naturalized as a US citizen. There are several steps before actually "being naturalized", including several petition phases. Here an an excerpt from archives.gov regarding the US naturalization process.

> In general, naturalization was a two-step process* that took a minimum of five years. After residing in the United States for two years, an alien could file a "declaration of intention" ("first papers") to become a citizen. After three additional years, the alien could "petition for naturalization" (”second papers”). After the petition was granted, a certificate of citizenship was issued to the alien. These two steps did not have to take place in the same court. [*Exceptions can include cases of derivative citizenship, processes for minor aliens 1824-1906, and special consideration for veterans.]

Ancestry helped me find the petition documents (which was so helpful in drawing the timeline). I had do additional research to find his actual date of naturalization.

### January 3rd - January 6th, 2020

After my initial research I was fairly confident I was eligible under current Italian Law. I saw others online had a lot of difficulty original Italian birth record.

- Try to book consulate appointment (fail)
  - failed to get Booking on January time slot

### Feb 4 - Feb 18th, 2020

Feb 4th - logged on right at 4pm (Boston time, I was in Japan). I wasn’t able to get an appointment. Another month of waiting :/

I logged in every couple days to see if I could snag an appointment. One day I _did_ actually see an opening - it was for the next day though, and I was neither prepared with with documents, nor in Boston! Oh well.

### Feb 19th, 2020

Some movement! I got an email back from USCIS. They had found the required naturalization documents I need, and confirmed for me that my great grandfather had been naturalized _after_ my _grandfather had been born. Good news!_ The bad news - I need to pay another \$65 to actually get the documents mailed to me...

On February 20th I requested the records to be mailed to me.
