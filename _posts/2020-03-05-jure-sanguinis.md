[Jure Sanguinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis), or "right of blood", is a principle of nationality law that many countries (notably for me, Italy) uses to determine citizenship. I grew up hearing about my great maternal grandparents who immigrated from Italy. I discovered jure sanguinis and wondered if I was eligible. If I was eligible, I would be able to claim my citizenship, and eventually apply for an Italian passport, allowing me to live and work in the EU indefinitely.

I won't go into the full details of understanding if you qualify (there are some great resources [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_nationality_law) and [here](https://www.myitalianfamily.com/apply-italian-citizenship/learn-if-you-qualify).

If you determine you qualify, you'll essentially need proof of unbroken Italian lineage (ending at you) in the form of birth, marriage, death, and naturalization certificates. This includes birth records of your most recent Italian ancestor. You'll need all of these internationally certified and translated to Italian. You'll then need to book an appointment with an your local Italian consulate, pay Italy some money, wait for Italy to give you the thumbs up.

The Boston consulate website provides this [informational document](https://consboston.esteri.it/consolato_boston/resource/doc/2016/05/juresanguinis.pdf) that clearly lays out all the documents they expect the day of your appointment.

A key thing to note for many Americans (that may disqualify you) is whether your Italian relative renounced his citizenship in favor of naturalizing in a foreign country (like the US), and whether their child (your next link in the chain) was born before or after. You'll need to take another close look at the dates if your Italian relatives were female (due to some antiquated Italian statutes...ugh).

Some things to note for _my_ particular search. I (1) live in Boston and am under the juristiction of the [Boston Italian Consulate](https://consboston.esteri.it/consolato_boston/it/), (2) all of my ascendents relevant to this process have lived their lives completely in Massachusetts (birth, marriage, etc...). I've seen online some people that had to get certain documents from various states (eg: Mom was born in state X, Dad in state Y, and married in state Z). That is not the case for me, which simplifies a lot! Your mileage may vary if you live elsewhere. Below is the entire timeline outlining my process for claiming (or failing in claiming) Italian citizenship.

A warning - this process is not particularly simple, cheap, or quick. Proceed at your own risk of sanity.

## Timeline

### December 31st, 2019

This process all began at a New Year’s Eve party. I was told by a friend that her parents had claimed her Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis. I knew my maternal family had emigrated from Italy - that got me curious (and down this rabbit hole!).

### January 1st, 2020

I first started by asking my family (namely my mom and my aunt) about what they remembered of their grandparents. They were very helpful - my aunt even had a couple relevant documents (and photos of my grandfather!).

I then moved onto a free trial on [Ancestry.com](http://ancestry.com), which was incredibly helpful. Most of my family tree was already partially constructed. Ancestry showed that my maternal grandparents had arrived to the United States around the turn of the century, with my grandfather being the first one of my maternal family born in the United States.

The most interesting find were the original Petition for Naturalization records for my great-grandfather. I found original scans of the documents on Ancestry stating his full name, birth date, date of arrival in the US, and more.

As I said above, an important “gotcha” is to note when my great grandfather _actually_ naturalized as a US citizen. There are several steps before actually "being naturalized", including several petition phases. Here an an excerpt from archives.gov regarding the US naturalization process.

> In general, naturalization was a two-step process* that took a minimum of five years. (1) After residing in the United States for two years, an alien could file a "declaration of intention" ("first papers") to become a citizen. (1) After three additional years, the alien could "petition for naturalization" (”second papers”). (1) After the petition was granted, a certificate of citizenship was issued to the alien. These two steps did not have to take place in the same court. [*Exceptions can include cases of derivative citizenship, processes for minor aliens 1824-1906, and special consideration for veterans.] _from: archives.gov_

Ancestry helped me find the petition documents (which was so helpful in drawing an accurate immigration timeline). I had do additional research to find his actual date of naturalization.

### January 3rd - January 6th, 2020

I did three things between these dates that, according to others online, took a long time. (1) Got Italian relative's birth record, (2) Try to book consulate appointment, and (3) Run a US naturalization search.

(1) After my initial research I was fairly confident I was eligible under current Italian Law. I saw others online had a lot of difficulty original Italian birth record, so I decided to start with getting my great-grandfather's birth record from his hometown in Italy (which I found from that naturalization record!). I used a website which, in exchange for a fee, would reach out and request the birth record.

> Future Note: While I did successfully get my g-grandfather's record from this website, I was also able to successful get my g-grandmother's record by simply sending a letter to the correct Italian comune. The Italian comune sent me the birth record for _free_! YMMV - but won't hurt to try asking yourself first before turning to a service.

(2) I also saw others say online how long it took to book a consulate appointment, sometimes waiting years after acquiring all the necessary documents!

The Boston consulate only opens new appointments the first Monday of each month (at around 3:55 PM ET)! I logged in on January 6th, and with a blind of my eyes all the apppointments appeared and vanished. I'd have to be faster next time...

(3) I began a [geneology index search](https://genealogy.uscis.dhs.gov/) to get the proof my great-grandfather naturalized after his son (my grandfather) was born. This is necessary to prove continuity in the Italian bloodline. Even if your relative didn't naturalize, you'll still need to run this to provide a "No Record Exists" to the consulate. All I needed was basic info about my great-grandfather to kick off the search.

### January 10th, 2020

I realized my application would be more complete if I also had my great-grandmother's birth record. She was born in Casalvecchio di Puglia, Italy. I decided to try my luck and send them a letter explaining what I wanted (my great-grandmother's birth record). I used my little knowledge of Italian to write a letter to their conmune's government office. I signed the letter and also attached a copy of my ID.

I found the address of the comune with a quick Google search, and mailed the letter off, expecting little of it returning.

### Feb 4 - Feb 18th, 2020

Another first Monday of the month! I was sure to be logged into the consulate website a few minutes before 4pm to be ready to snag a citizenship appointment. I was actually in a different time zone (Japan!) and woke up at 6am (which was 4pm Boston). To my disappointment, I was not quick enough again.

I logged in every couple days to see if I could snag a canceled appointment. One day I _did_ actually see an opening - it was for the next day though, and I was neither prepared with all the documents, nor in Boston! Oh well. It's good to note that cancellation _do_ show up outside of the "first monday" openings.

### Feb 19th, 2020

Some movement! I got an email back from USCIS. They had found the required naturalization documents I need, and confirmed for me that my great grandfather had been naturalized _after_ my grandfather had been born. Good news! The bad news - I need to pay another \$65 to actually get the documents mailed to me...

I began the USCIS genealogy search on January 3rd, and it completed on February 18th.

I started the actual record request (to be mailed to me) on February 19th.

### March 2nd, 2020

What a surprise! I opened the mailbox one day to a letter from Casalvecchio di Puglia! Inside the officials had included my great-grandmother's birth record! I'm sure there is usually a fee associated with this - I think they did me a favor by not writing back asking for money, thanks guys!

### March 3rd, 2020

This was now my third month in a row trying to get an appointment. Thankfully, I got one this time! Bad news, it was in October 2021.

### March 4th, 2020

I got an email back from the Italian document service saying they had received my great-grandfather's birth record back from Italy! I saw a scan of the document, and got a tracking number for the original document to be sent to me.

## TBD

That's all for now! I'll be updating this as more develops!
