> Every month I pour all my favorite tunes into a playlist with that name (this year, in Turkish because why not). Here's my reflections back on 2019 through Spotify.

## [ocak](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6UKHwCMYwRmij4ibqBYzQA?si=CRJqKstzQhmeBWO8nLXnBg)

**January** -- I'd just gotten back home to Boston from a semester abroad! Lots of [Quinn XCII](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ApUX1o6oSz321MMECyIYd?si=AUdir2G2S5aiohkjJUUcXw) & [Ripe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19lQ2rJLlP71FOKESiMNJT?si=eU-RzMhtQK2pyl-2uF2Hxw) in preparation for their upcoming concerts!

## [şubat](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jOKuLZ4IATEJmId3ebCm3?si=T2c3fSQJSXePcEjOSOm5tg)

**February** -- February marks the month of new friends and experiences. Influences from the people I most care about ([Mom Rock](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6xwv9O4HYAqPMp1bbSqufi?si=E-7K8GKbRfKYmwVN5KirNQ), [The Districts](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3HZgaiR960RFqx9d4LPraD?si=VQoB-_ymQFacv7QFQe2FZQ), and [Shag Rock](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0SJxTOELZJa2Cf19TjNEfm?si=jbsUtrn0SOWUpSLvh0oZdA)). Lots of new music in my life!

## [mart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kAyMOSRWqufbPrqpdsnAg?si=gn5K1WQXSpuKAzCwZgslTg)

**March** -- I am shown [Applesauce](https://open.spotify.com/track/2bsTfDQBc5kmDReErSCrtD?si=WahooIoQQrefYzYqCMcBng) by someone really special -- this playlist should just be called Applesauce given how much I listened.

## [nisan](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4co9gLLFFkSygUoJ0UzKiV?si=LjLUiz10SBKL3tT5P2XhBw)

**April** -- Applesauce makes an appearance along with Abhi the Nomad! The playlist turns a bit more introspective with songs like [Why Not Me](https://open.spotify.com/track/1gewwJHPkvysxLEGgOKQuB?si=TPOOWxnlTG6UPQFL5jGFeg) & the some greats tracks by artist [HONNE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Vw76uk7P8yVtTClWyOhac?si=nFX02UmpTh2XrI8R4j2fvQ). We also see a track by [Dionysia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5MJRmOUoZK7vJxcvsXYdQQ?si=hSYZtShiTCivXEComZPgQw) from one of my favorite Sofars of all time! April was definitely the most impactful month of my year, and the music definitely shows.

## [mayıs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5pLtO3pMyyfvrHQkcjJcx4?si=-SWUaCxfTS-0cC140gZZdQ)

**May** -- May was fun and the music shows! I traveled to Spain with my family, went to plenty of shows, and transitioned from my spring co-op into my summer internship! This playlist is the start of summer - listening to this playlist makes me feel like i'm driving to the beach with my windows down.

## [haziran](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OvNZ8NC3jS9S8RrbD1qdX?si=t0yCvY2CTJmSm3j3gfniag)

**June** -- I arrive in Seattle for the summer. I traveled a lot so this playlist is quite large. My summer anthem [Heat of the Summer](https://open.spotify.com/track/649o53ULWYN1y7V2OI5kgo?si=_sTqTTTAQkOsmWtOW9xvog) makes its first appearance.

## [temmuz](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nsrAJ9mpBPo2BeO2HoigJ?si=Li8a5dHvQIOwchO1kMHJ-A)

**July** -- July marks me settling into Seattle, making new friends, and discovering new music! I am introduced (and see live) the band [Lawrence](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nsrAJ9mpBPo2BeO2HoigJ?si=DTFreb_tSCC9hOjT9RGiUw).

## [ağustos](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2jvJkfIwlFMSVSycofM2Xr?si=mz82qccbREmM8nEIXF5m2Q)

**August** -- August is a short playlist. The month was busy & included lots of wrapping up in Settle and a move back home to Boston. [The Happy Fits, ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/73rPcaYEhBd0UuVZBqqyQJ?si=DcLExG5bTDGED6zJo07zyQ) [Arlie, ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Bllzm0olEwqGwPujaLiuA?si=dqP1PS3uQuSyv86zfqRSxg) and [Sure Sure](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1anAI9P9iSzc9qzLv6AtHZ?si=CJGE4_iaTYikxR4a-3NzXQ) are two welcome additions.

## [eylül](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nFlfBFjsJtoLUzNdfYbV4?si=vNmkt5tnRKegYBLJc6dsFg)

**September** -- I'm back taking classes at Northeastern for what has felt like forever. September is a good month.

## [ekim](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/53VbOgwMiMnnSYpYgmEsp0?si=lZH-KFpWRj-Qw1TC_I8suQ)

**October** -- My birth month! [Half Alive](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7sOR7gk6XUlGnxj3p9F54k?si=BEZYkIeoTz-pU4urZnttNg) rocks this month. This playlist was huge had a long of fun music. One of which is actually called [Playlist by Kid Quill](https://open.spotify.com/track/0QXbKnplTUrae3P1P7xdq2?si=O_bEtfNEQ66WbZGTb6gZRQ).

## [Kasım](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/33NhBfhpKhSgms8tqYC5Q7?si=nY_EbWJBQEq-ntMNR_UxvQ)

**November** -- A short playlist, but one I listened too non-stop while finishing out my degree. [Rex Orange County's](https://open.spotify.com/track/7vRia9rlEuTDQxkfXIKySi?si=4Ipf9ofSSfijfgUYK-gZrw) new album was on constant loop. [Surfaces](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ETSs924pXMzjIeD6E9b4u?si=rmUDPodKQ-6jgD1drhFM2g) also emerged as one of my favorite artists of the month.

## [Aralık](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2UzX5DT4tUmdzRu693LqlU?si=FdXWSXhkQBG-MdNomkuq0A)

**December** -- December is mostly bleed over from November's top hits. December was a stressful month - ending school is not something I was prepared for. [Take This Love by Brothers + Company](https://open.spotify.com/track/74ehQPUbiEVkUM0UdmkVzc?si=R514NE8ZQEKXqGXHUVgo2A) played in my head constantly throughout the month. Finally, a great sum up for the very end of this year - [Dining Alone by Shakey Graves](https://open.spotify.com/track/3JSlnsGTuO1tAMpgWy7tBz?si=VwcRmiQTRRWS28xVl9uXZg).
